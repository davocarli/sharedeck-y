# DeckSettingsEX

## Description

A Decky Plugin for browsing recommended Steam Deck game settings from [ShareDeck](https://sharedeck.games) and [SteamDeckHQ](https://steamdeckhq.com/)

This is a fork of @davocarli's [DeckSettings](https://github.com/davocarli/sharedeck-y) plugin with updates to support the latest versions of Decky.

Allows you to see the recommended settings, and supports sending notifications when you open a game that has reported settings.

Built with [Decky Plugin Loader](https://github.com/SteamDeckHomebrew/PluginLoader).

## Current Features

DeckSettingsEX currently supports browsing reports for any steam games in your Steam Library.
